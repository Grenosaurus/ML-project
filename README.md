# ML-project
Machine Learning in Material Science project

This program generates multiple solar cell dataset graphs. Purpose of this program is to study the connection of solar cell temperature and solar cell efficiency.

Program is called by selecting first correct directory and correctly named dataset. This program considers the datasets name to be the solar cell temperature for easily accessign the dataset from the specific folder.

Program is runned in the following method after going to the folder where the program is in your OS shell:
 - If Windows -> python .\solarEfficiency.py
 - If Linux -> python3 solarEfficiency.py
